# Store API

## üìù Project Overview

This project is a **RESTful API** developed using **Django Rest Framework**.  
It serves as the backend for both **mobile apps** and **web-based e-commerce platforms**.

The goal of this project is to follow **REST architecture principles** and implement **clean code practices** throughout
the codebase. It provides all the necessary endpoints for a store application, including user management, product
handling, and other e-commerce features.

This API is designed to be easily scalable and maintainable, and can be connected to any frontend or mobile app that
communicates via HTTP.
